## tokenRequestSpec
TokenRequestSpec contains client provided parameters of a token request.

**Functions:**

[`fn .withAudiences`](#fn-withaudiences)  
[`fn .withExpirationSeconds`](#fn-withexpirationseconds)  
[`fn boundObjectRef.withName`](#fn-boundobjectrefwithname)  
[`fn boundObjectRef.withUid`](#fn-boundobjectrefwithuid)  

---


### `fn .withAudiences`
Audiences are the intendend audiences of the token. A recipient of a token must identitfy themself with an identifier in the list of audiences of the token, and otherwise should reject the token. A token issued for multiple audiences may be used to authenticate against any of the audiences listed but implies a high degree of trust between the target audiences.
```jsonnet
{
  withAudiences(audiences):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withExpirationSeconds`
ExpirationSeconds is the requested duration of validity of the request. The token issuer may return a token with a different validity duration so a client needs to check the 'expiration' field in a response.
```jsonnet
{
  withExpirationSeconds(expirationSeconds):: {}
}
```

### `fn boundObjectRef.withName`
Name of the referent.
```jsonnet
{
  withName(name):: {}
}
```

### `fn boundObjectRef.withUid`
UID of the referent.
```jsonnet
{
  withUid(uid):: {}
}
```
