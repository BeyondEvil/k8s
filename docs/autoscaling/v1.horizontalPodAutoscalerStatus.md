---


### `fn .withCurrentCPUUtilizationPercentage`
current average CPU utilization over all pods, represented as a percentage of requested CPU, e.g. 70 means that an average pod is using now 70% of its requested CPU.
```jsonnet
{
  withCurrentCPUUtilizationPercentage(currentCPUUtilizationPercentage):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withCurrentReplicas`
current number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.
```jsonnet
{
  withCurrentReplicas(currentReplicas):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withDesiredReplicas`
desired number of replicas of pods managed by this autoscaler.
```jsonnet
{
  withDesiredReplicas(desiredReplicas):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withLastScaleTime`
Time is a wrapper around time.Time which supports correct marshaling to YAML and JSON.  Wrappers are provided for many of the factory methods that the time package offers.
```jsonnet
{
  withLastScaleTime(lastScaleTime):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withObservedGeneration`
most recent generation observed by this autoscaler.
```jsonnet
{
  withObservedGeneration(observedGeneration):: {}
}
```
