### `fn .withFsType`
Filesystem type to mount. It applies only when the Path is a block device. Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system. Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". The default value is to auto-select a fileystem if unspecified.
```jsonnet
{
  withFsType(fsType):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withPath`
The full path to the volume on the node. It can be either a directory or block device (disk, partition, ...).
```jsonnet
{
  withPath(path):: {}
}
```
