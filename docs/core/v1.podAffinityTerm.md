## podAffinityTerm
Defines a set of pods (namely those matching the labelSelector relative to the given namespace(s)) that this pod should be co-located (affinity) or not co-located (anti-affinity) with, where co-located is defined as running on a node whose value of the label with key <topologyKey> matches that of any node on which a pod of the set of pods is running

### `fn .withNamespaces`
namespaces specifies which namespaces the labelSelector applies to (matches against); null or empty list means "this pod's namespace"
```jsonnet
{
  withNamespaces(namespaces):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withTopologyKey`
This pod should be co-located (affinity) or not co-located (anti-affinity) with the pods matching the labelSelector in the specified namespaces, where co-located is defined as running on a node whose value of the label with key topologyKey matches that of any node on which any of the selected pods is running. Empty topologyKey is not allowed.
```jsonnet
{
  withTopologyKey(topologyKey):: {}
}
```

### `fn labelSelector.withMatchExpressions`
matchExpressions is a list of label selector requirements. The requirements are ANDed.
```jsonnet
{
  withMatchExpressions(matchExpressions):: {}
}
```

### `fn labelSelector.withMatchLabels`
matchLabels is a map of {key,value} pairs. A single {key,value} in the matchLabels map is equivalent to an element of matchExpressions, whose key field is "key", the operator is "In", and the values array contains only "value". The requirements are ANDed.
```jsonnet
{
  withMatchLabels(matchLabels):: {}
}
```
