### `fn .withHost`
Host name to connect to, defaults to the pod IP. You probably want to set "Host" in httpHeaders instead.
```jsonnet
{
  withHost(host):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withHttpHeaders`
Custom headers to set in the request. HTTP allows repeated headers.
```jsonnet
{
  withHttpHeaders(httpHeaders):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withPath`
Path to access on the HTTP server.
```jsonnet
{
  withPath(path):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withPort`
IntOrString is a type that can hold an int32 or a string.  When used in JSON or YAML marshalling and unmarshalling, it produces or consumes the inner type.  This allows you to have, for example, a JSON field that can accept a name or number.
```jsonnet
{
  withPort(port):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withScheme`
Scheme to use for connecting to the host. Defaults to HTTP.
```jsonnet
{
  withScheme(scheme):: {}
}
```
