---


### `fn .withMountPath`
Path within the container at which the volume should be mounted.  Must not contain ':'.
```jsonnet
{
  withMountPath(mountPath):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withMountPropagation`
mountPropagation determines how mounts are propagated from the host to container and the other way around. When not set, MountPropagationNone is used. This field is beta in 1.10.
```jsonnet
{
  withMountPropagation(mountPropagation):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withName`
This must match the Name of a Volume.
```jsonnet
{
  withName(name):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withReadOnly`
Mounted read-only if true, read-write otherwise (false or unspecified). Defaults to false.
```jsonnet
{
  withReadOnly(readOnly):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withSubPath`
Path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted. Defaults to "" (volume's root).
```jsonnet
{
  withSubPath(subPath):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withSubPathExpr`
Expanded path within the volume from which the container's volume should be mounted. Behaves similarly to SubPath but environment variable references $(VAR_NAME) are expanded using the container's environment. Defaults to "" (volume's root). SubPathExpr and SubPath are mutually exclusive. This field is beta in 1.15.
```jsonnet
{
  withSubPathExpr(subPathExpr):: {}
}
```
