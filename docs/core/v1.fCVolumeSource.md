### `fn .withFsType`
Filesystem type to mount. Must be a filesystem type supported by the host operating system. Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". Implicitly inferred to be "ext4" if unspecified.
```jsonnet
{
  withFsType(fsType):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withLun`
Optional: FC target lun number
```jsonnet
{
  withLun(lun):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withReadOnly`
Optional: Defaults to false (read/write). ReadOnly here will force the ReadOnly setting in VolumeMounts.
```jsonnet
{
  withReadOnly(readOnly):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withTargetWWNs`
Optional: FC target worldwide names (WWNs)
```jsonnet
{
  withTargetWWNs(targetWWNs):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withWwids`
Optional: FC volume world wide identifiers (wwids) Either wwids or combination of targetWWNs and lun must be set, but not both simultaneously.
```jsonnet
{
  withWwids(wwids):: {}
}
```
