## loadBalancerIngress
LoadBalancerIngress represents the status of a load-balancer ingress point: traffic intended for the service should be sent to an ingress point.

**Functions:**

[`fn .withHostname`](#fn-withhostname)  
[`fn .withIp`](#fn-withip)  

---


### `fn .withHostname`
Hostname is set for load-balancer ingress points that are DNS based (typically AWS load-balancers)
```jsonnet
{
  withHostname(hostname):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withIp`
IP is set for load-balancer ingress points that are IP based (typically GCE or OpenStack load-balancers)
```jsonnet
{
  withIp(ip):: {}
}
```
