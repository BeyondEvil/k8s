### `fn .withDriver`
Driver is the name of the CSI driver that handles this volume. Consult with your admin for the correct name as registered in the cluster.
```jsonnet
{
  withDriver(driver):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withFsType`
Filesystem type to mount. Ex. "ext4", "xfs", "ntfs". If not provided, the empty value is passed to the associated CSI driver which will determine the default filesystem to apply.
```jsonnet
{
  withFsType(fsType):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withReadOnly`
Specifies a read-only configuration for the volume. Defaults to false (read/write).
```jsonnet
{
  withReadOnly(readOnly):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withVolumeAttributes`
VolumeAttributes stores driver-specific properties that are passed to the CSI driver. Consult your driver's documentation for supported values.
```jsonnet
{
  withVolumeAttributes(volumeAttributes):: {}
}
```

### `fn nodePublishSecretRef.withName`
Name of the referent. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#names
```jsonnet
{
  withName(name):: {}
}
```
