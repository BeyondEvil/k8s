## scopedResourceSelectorRequirement
A scoped-resource selector requirement is a selector that contains values, a scope name, and an operator that relates the scope name and values.

**Functions:**

[`fn .withOperator`](#fn-withoperator)  
[`fn .withScopeName`](#fn-withscopename)  
[`fn .withValues`](#fn-withvalues)  

---


### `fn .withOperator`
Represents a scope's relationship to a set of values. Valid operators are In, NotIn, Exists, DoesNotExist.
```jsonnet
{
  withOperator(operator):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withScopeName`
The name of the scope that the selector applies to.
```jsonnet
{
  withScopeName(scopeName):: {}
}
```

### `fn .withValues`
An array of string values. If the operator is In or NotIn, the values array must be non-empty. If the operator is Exists or DoesNotExist, the values array must be empty. This array is replaced during a strategic merge patch.
```jsonnet
{
  withValues(values):: {}
}
```
